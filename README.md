# BowExploitFixer
This is plugin for 1.17 Spigot/Bukkit Minecraft's servers. This plugin fixes BowExploit(BowBomb) that found recently. Meteor Client developers released their fix, but the problem is that it fixes vanills arrow mechanics. Together I with https://github.com/l1tecorejz we made a plugin that fixes the exploit and doesn't "kill" vanilla arrow mechanics. Also made it possible to customize messages for warns/kick.
